# springboot-microservices

This project demonstrates the implementation of microservices with Spring Boot. I have implemented two services as separate microservices, each running on its own designated port. These services are interconnected through an API gateway, consolidating access through a single port.

For streamlined monitoring and configuration management, the services are orchestrated using a service registry and a config server. To enhance monitoring capabilities, Prometheus, Micrometer, and Actuator have been employed as robust monitoring tools.
